# Overlapping_Intervals

Given a collection of Intervals, the task is to merge all of the overlapping Intervals.

Example 1:

Input:

Intervals = {{1,3},{2,4},{6,8},{9,10}}

Output: 

{{1, 4}, {6, 8}, {9, 10}}

Explanation: 

Given intervals: [1,3],[2,4],[6,8],[9,10] we have only two overlapping intervals here,[1,3] and [2,4]. 
Therefore we will merge these two and return [1,4],[6,8], [9,10].
